‚Ä¢ Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL for data
‚Ä¢ Vite on the frontend
‚Ä¢ Celery + Redis for background tasks
‚Ä¢ FastAPI Oath2 for manager authentication
‚Ä¢ Slack, Twilio, Stripe integrations

‚∏ª

## üèó Phase 1: Project Setup

    1.	Monorepo or multi-folder structure (pick your preference):
    ‚Ä¢	[x] /backend: Contains FastAPI + Celery + Prisma code
    ‚Ä¢	[x] /frontend: Contains React app
    ‚Ä¢	[x] README.md: Explains the project layout and how to set up each part
    2.	Initialize FastAPI backend:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create main.py (or app.py) as the entry point
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Install packages:
    ‚Ä¢	fastapi
    ‚Ä¢	uvicorn[standard]
    ‚Ä¢	pydantic
    ‚Ä¢	python-dotenv (optional, if using .env)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Write minimal FastAPI app with a single route
    3.	Create a /health endpoint:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Define GET /health returning { "status": "ok" }
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Test locally via curl or browser
    4.	Environment variables:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create .env file for DB credentials, secrets, etc.
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Optionally use a Pydantic settings loader in config.py
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Keep .env out of source control (add to .gitignore)
    5.	Local installation of Postgres & Redis:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Install PostgreSQL on your system (or use a remote instance)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create a database (e.g., speedy_status_db)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Install and start Redis (listening on localhost:6379)
    6.	React frontend setup (no Next.js):
    ‚Ä¢	[x] In /frontend, create a React + TypeScript project (e.g., with Vite or Create React App)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS (if desired)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Confirm you can run npm start (or yarn dev) and see a basic page

‚∏ª

## üìÑ Phase 2: Database Models & Migrations (Prisma)

    1.	Install & configure Prisma:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] pip install prisma-client-py
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create a prisma/ folder in /backend
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Add schema.prisma referencing your Postgres DB via env var (DATABASE_URL)
    2.	Define Prisma models in schema.prisma:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] User
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Team
    ‚Ä¢	[x] TeamMembership
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Submission
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Subscription
    ‚Ä¢	[x] ScheduledPromptJob
    ‚Ä¢	[x] WeeklySummary
    3.	Run Prisma migrations:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] prisma migrate dev --name init (or prisma db push)
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Verify tables in PostgreSQL
    4.	Prisma client usage:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Generate the Python Prisma client
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Test queries in a small script or route (e.g. create a User record)
    5.	Optional seed script:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create a script to insert sample data: manager user, test team, etc.

‚∏ª

## üîê Phase 3: Authentication & Authorization

    1.	Integrate FastAPI OAuth2:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Install fastapi-users or python-jose for JWT handling
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create routes for:
    ‚Ä¢	/auth/login (with username/password)
    ‚Ä¢	/auth/token (OAuth2 token endpoint)
    ‚Ä¢	/auth/logout
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Configure OAuth2 with Password flow and Bearer token authentication
    2.	Protect manager routes:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create OAuth2 scopes for manager role
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Use FastAPI dependencies with security_scopes to protect routes
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Add OAuth2 bearer token validation middleware
    3.	Magic link for team members:
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Use JWT tokens with short expiry for magic links
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Create GET/POST routes at /api/v1/magic-links/{token}
    ‚Ä¢	[x] Set token expiry to 72 hours with no refresh token

## üìÖ Phase 4: Team Setup & Configuration

    1.	Team creation flow:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] POST /team for manager to create a new team
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] POST /team/members to add members by email
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] PUT /team/schedule to set day/time/timezone
    2.	Prompt schedule:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Store promptDay, promptTime, timezone in the Team record
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Convert local times to UTC behind the scenes
    3.	Frontend integration:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Provide a basic UI in React for manager to create/edit a team
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Show success or errors from the backend

‚∏ª

## üïí Phase 5: Prompt Scheduling (Celery + Redis)

    1.	Install & configure Celery:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] pip install celery
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Create a celery_app.py or similar with config pointing to Redis at localhost:6379
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Add tasks module for background jobs
    2.	ScheduledPromptJob logic**:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] For each team, read promptDay, promptTime, schedule a job
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Option: Celery Beat or a custom cron to enqueue tasks
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Track job status (pending, sent, failed)
    3.	Prompt-sending tasks:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] send_prompt(team_id) Celery task stubs out:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Email or Slack DM or Twilio call
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Store job results in ScheduledPromptJob

‚∏ª

## ‚úçÔ∏è Phase 6: Submission System

    1.	Submission API:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] POST /api/v1/submissions
    ‚Ä¢	Validates token (if magic link) or Slack/Twilio signature
    ‚Ä¢	Saves submission with userId, teamId, content
    ‚Ä¢	Marks is_late if after schedule deadline
    2.	Frontend submission form (for email link):
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Minimal page that appears when user clicks magic link
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Textarea for status update
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Submit to /api/v1/submissions with the token
    3.	Allow edits:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Decide if users can resubmit until manager's summary is generated
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Store or overwrite existing submissions

‚∏ª

## ü§ñ Phase 7: AI Summary Generation

    1.	AI integration:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Use GPT-like model or "GPT-4o-mini" (stub or real)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Prompt template for summarizing weekly updates
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Save result in WeeklySummary with generatedAt
    2.	Trigger conditions:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Generate summary automatically once all members submit
    ‚Ä¢	OR [ ] Generate summary after a 24-hour grace period from the scheduled time
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Manual trigger: /api/v1/summaries/generate for manager to force summary
    3.	Regeneration on late updates:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] If late submission arrives, re-run summary logic
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Overwrite previous text or store versioning

‚∏ª

## üìß Phase 8: Multi-Channel Notifications

    1.	Email prompt system:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Setup an email service (SendGrid, SMTP, etc.)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Weekly "It's time to submit" email with a magic link
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Manager summary email after generation
    2.	Slack integration:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Create Slack app, configure OAuth
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Send DM with a link or accept direct text as submission
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] (Optional) Post summary in a Slack channel for the manager
    3.	Twilio phone prompts (optional):
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Configure Twilio phone number
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Call flow: user hears instructions ‚Üí records or keys in update
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Transcribe and store as submission
    4.	Reminders:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] If user hasn't submitted by X time, send a reminder DM/email/call

‚∏ª

## üè∑ Phase 9: Manager Dashboard

    1.	Dashboard APIs:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] GET /api/v1/teams/{teamId}/dashboard
    ‚Ä¢	Returns team info, submissions, summary
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] PUT /api/v1/teams/{teamId}/dashboard (if editing schedule or members)
    2.	React dashboard:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Route: /dashboard
    ‚Ä¢	[ ]] List all teams the manager has
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Display each team's weekly status, who submitted, who hasn't
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] View or regenerate summary
    3.	Resend prompt & reminders:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Button to resend prompt to non-responders
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Confirm or success message after

‚∏ª

## üí≥ Final Phase: Payments & Production Launch

    1.	Stripe integration:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] POST /api/v1/billing/subscribe takes a Stripe payment method
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Subscription table stores plan tier (free, paid) and status
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Webhook to handle subscription updates/cancellations
    2.	Enforce free vs. paid tier:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Free tier: 1 active team or limited features (your choice)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] If usage exceeds free plan, require upgrade
    3.	Soft deletes & data retention:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] If a team is deleted, mark is_deleted = true or similar
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Keep data for historical analytics unless manager requests purge
    4.	Monitoring & error handling:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Add Sentry or similar for error tracking
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Implement logging for Celery tasks and critical API calls
    5.	Production deployment (no Docker):
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Install Python, Postgres, Redis on your server or use managed services
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Copy code, set up environment variables for secrets (Stripe, Slack, Twilio)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Start FastAPI with a production server (e.g., gunicorn or uvicorn in production mode)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Start Celery worker (celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info)
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Serve React build via a static file server or Node-based hosting
    6.	QA & smoke tests:
    ‚Ä¢	[ ] Test end-to-end: manager login ‚Üí create team ‚Üí add member ‚Üí schedule prompt ‚Üí member submits ‚Üí manager sees summary
    ‚Ä¢	[ ]] Verify Slack/Twilio/Stripe integrations in a test environment
